# KUKA CYBERTECH Mock Config

A MoveIt Pro mock configuration for a KUKA CYBERTECH robot.

To change the model of robot, simply change the `robot_model` urdf parameter  in the `config.yaml` file to a model described in `kuka_experimental`.

This config is for running Moveit Pro with ROS2 control mock hardware and does not start up with a GPIO controller.
